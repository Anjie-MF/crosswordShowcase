## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

You can add code snippets using the syntax:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
console.log('Ã°Å¸Å½â€°')
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas for future improvement in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [The Word Finder](https://www.thewordfinder.com/crossword-puzzle-maker/) - Used the form to generate my own crossword puzzle, which significantly helped in ensuring that the words fit well together and in providing a solid wireframe for the puzzle.

- [SheCodes](https://shorturl.at/s5Bib) - Used to learn how to display the current date and time using the built-in `Date()` object, which helped with correct formatting, and the html as well 

- [Piccalil](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - My go-to CSS Reset. While working on Frontend Mentor projects, Grace Snow provided valuable feedback about my CSS style. She strongly suggested using a CSS reset to improve my code's cleanliness and efficiency.

## Credits

- Microsoft -  [CoPilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) - I used an AI companion (Copilot) to generate crossword clue ideas. The prompt used was:

```For the crossword puzzle, write the "Across" clues focusing on programming languages and technologies, while the "Down" clues emphasize professional traits.```
