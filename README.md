You can add code snippets using the syntax:

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
console.log('Ã°Å¸Å½â€°')
}
```

## AI prompts

- Microsoft -  [CoPilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) - I used an AI companion (Copilot) to generate crossword clue ideas. The prompt used was:

```I'm creating a crossword puzzle for my developer portfolio. Could you provide clues that focus on popular programming languages and technologies? Also, I need clues that highlight professional traits. The puzzle should fit within a 5 across and 4 down grid, totaling 20 boxes.```

- OpenAI - [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) - I used an AI companion (ChatGPT) to help create a personal Q&A framework for understanding the new concepts I learned while building this project. The prompt I used to guide the discussion was:

```Ok, I tried to google this answer and got a multitude of solutions. How do I learn what to google? I don't want to copy and paste. I want to learn the fundamentals behind it. Like, what articles do I need to read to come to the answer you did?```

This process helped me deepen my understanding and learn to independently explore related topics effectively.
